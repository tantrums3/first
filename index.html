    <p>Hello Visitor! <br />
       Welcome to the tutorials! Much of the lessons are based on content available at the w3schools website.<br />
       The tutorials are created with very little css because there is intent on keeping the lessons simple. <br />
       The purpose of the tutorials is to make it easy to learn JavaScript. <br />
       Before we start, there is something that has to come first.</p>    
    <br />
    Let us start by checking if you have JavaScript enabled within the blue box below.<br /><br />
    <p style="background-color:lightcyan; color:red; border: 2px solid black; padding:30px">
        <script>window.alert("JavaScript is ENABLED!")</script>
        <noscript>Page loading...<br /><br />You don't have JavaScript enabled; please enable it.</noscript>
    </p>
    <h3>Message appeared, what now?</h3>
    If you do not have JavaScript enabled then you will be seeing a message in the box below. <br />
    If there is a message, then you need to go to your browser's menu, find the settings, and within the settings find where
    JavaScript is enabled/disabled then change that setting.<br />
    <h3>No message, what does that mean?</h3>
    If no message appears then you will be able to work with the lessons from the tutorials and the container below will remain empty.<br />
    <hr />
    </div>
    <h2>Now on to the tutorials!</h2>
    <div>Please select a lesson from the menu.<br />
    <ul><li>Where to lis JavaScript</li>
        <li><a href="Html1-lesson1.html" />Document Object</a></li></ul>
    </div>

    <script src="js/main.js"></script>
