    <!--PLEASE NOTE:---------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <!--Always remember to leave a script that will inform the user if JavaSript needs  
        to be enabled within the browser settings. It should be a given that JavaScript
        comes already available, but there are those who will shut it off and forget
        to turn it back on. For notifying the user through a message, you can find other scripting
        samples on Stackoverflow: 
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/121203/how-to-detect-if-javascript-is-disabled.
        Good luck!
        The following is the code and the message for displaying
        that will detect if JavaScript is enabled and notify the user of the situation.

        <hr />
        Before reading the lesson, please note that the abbreviation JS is used here to represent JavaScript
        so that the entire word does not have to be written out.<br />
        Also, please note that you can reference
        the W3School's website to find the source from where I base all my lessons.
        
        <script>window.alert("JavaScript is ENABLED!")</script><noscript style="background-color:lightcyan; color:red; border: 2px solid black; padding:30px" ;>

        <h6>Using Attributes</h6>
        When writing the document.getElementById tag, there will need to be instructions that follow the period.<br />
        The instructions will always pertain to HTML, so therefore you need to be familiar
        the HTML attributes that will be possibilities to use with the [document.getElementById] tag.<br />
        There are several version of HTML ranging from 2.0 to 5 but any version before 5 is deprecated (out-dated)
        and do not work with well with newer versions of other technology (JavaScript, CSS, browser, etcetera).<br />
        So, be aware of what you are working with before you pick a version of HTML to use.<br />
        <br />
        HTML Attributes:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>innerHTML</li>
            <li>src</li>
            <li>style.display</li>
            <li>style.fontSize</li>


        </ul>
        <br />
        More HTML attributes can be found at https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp.
