    <!--This page uses JavaScript from the EMCAScript Edition 7 of the year 2016.-->
    <!--JavaScript/ECMAScript(1-7) was created to be best supported in browsers
        that include Netscape & Mozilla Firefox, however, ECMAScript 7 is new and
        therefore it is poorly supported in ALL browsers. ECMAScript 7 is only
        being used for the purpose of practice since it is not fit for current versions of
        major browsers. Major browsers that the W3Schools Website list includes
        IE10, Edge 12, Opera 15, Safari 6, Firefox 4 & 21, and Chrome 23; and
        although Vivaldi 1.11 is not on the list it is a contender.-->
    <!--Internet Explorer 9 uses EMCAScript5/2011's equivalent with
        Microsoft JScript 9.0/2011, therefore this script is not compatible with IE9/10.-->

        <h4>Lesson 1: The Document Object</h4>
        <hr />
        Before reading the lesson, please note that the abbreviation JS is used here to represent JavaScript
        so that the entire word does not have to be written out.<br /> Also, please note that you can reference
        the W3School's website to find the source from where I base the 'Date & Time' lesson.

        <h6>document.write</h6>
        The JS code that creates on the screen the texts to read is the 'write' property.<br />
        Using document.write then placing in the brackets what text to display will create
        whatever it is that should appear.<br />
        With the document.write object, you can write a line [write(ln)] that adds a line after the text,<br />
        or you can write a line that does not add a new line after the statement[write()].<br />
        <i>Here is an example:</i>
        < script>document.write("Hello ", [1 + 1], " you!");< /script>
        <h6>document.getElementBy</h6>
        You can use 'document.getElementBy Name, Id, classname, and tagname. For the purpose of this lesson we are using Id.<br />
        <i>Here is an example:</i> "document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()".<br />
        The JS code that makes the time appear when the user clicks the button is broken down as follows:<br /> 
        The JS code is placed inside the HTML element tag < button > < / button >.<br /> 
        The HTML tag code includes the 'type' attribute with the "button" variant, 
        followed by the onclick attribute, where the JS code is placed
        as the variant for the 'onclick' attribute of the 'button' element tag.<br /> 
        So, the first attribute you will see is the 'type' with button, and the second attribute is the 'onclick'
        attribute with the JS code.<br />
        < button  type = " button "  onclick = " JS code here " > followed by user instructions < / button >.
        <br />The 'type' attribute creates the 'id' for the place where the date and time will display on the screen
        < p   id = " demo " ></ p >.<br /> 
        The "document.getElementById('#').innerHTML = #()" is considered a
        nested (a tag listed in the body of the document) HTML element content where the getElementById creates the ID demo that is later retrieved by the
        paragraph element tag.<br /> 
        The .innerHTML instructs what content [Date()] the demo ID is to display
        inside the page.<br /> 
        The getElementById can be used to create ID's to perform all sorts of functions.<br />
        One function can be changing attributes of an element tag or even changing the variant of an attribute.

        <h3>Sample:</h3>
        In all, the following is what you have:    
        <h5>Hidden Code: </h5>
        < script>document.write("Hello ", [1 + 1], " you!");< /script>
        < button type = "button"
        onclick = "document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">
        Click me to display Date and Time.
        < /button >
        < p id="demo">< /p>
    </p>   
        <!------------------------------------'Date & Time' Script------------------------------------------>
        <!--Code script is the from W3Schools Website for displaying 'Date & Time'.-->
        <!--https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_myfirst.-->
        <!--This is the start of the 'Date & Time' script.-->    
        <h5>Displayed Function: </h5><h2>My First JavaScript</h2>
        <script>document.write("Hello ", [1 + 1], " you!");</script>    
        <button type="button"
                onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">
            Click me to display Date and Time.
        </button>    
        <p id="demo"></p>
        <!--Will show like the following sample: Mon Sep 18 2017 06:48:20 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)].-->
        <!--This is the end of the 'Date & Time' script.-->
